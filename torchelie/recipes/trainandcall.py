    Train a model and evaluate it with a custom function. The model is
    automatically registered and checkpointed as :code:`checkpoint['model']`,
    and put in eval mode when testing.

    Training callbacks:

    - Counter for counting iterations, connected to the testing loop as well
    - VisdomLogger
    - StdoutLogger

    Testing:

    Testing loop is in :code:`.test_loop`.

    Testing callbacks:

    - VisdomLogger
    - StdoutLogger
    - Checkpoint

    Args:
        model (nn.Model): a model
        train_fun (Callabble): a function that takes a batch as a single
            argument, performs a training step and return a dict of values to
            populate the recipe's state.
        test_fun (Callable): a function taking no argument that performs
            something to evaluate your model and returns a dict to populate the
            state.
        train_loader (DataLoader): Training set dataloader
        test_every (int): testing frequency, in number of iterations (default:
            100)
        visdom_env (str): name of the visdom environment to use, or None for
            not using Visdom (default: None)
        checkpoint (str): checkpointing path or None for no checkpointing
        log_every (int): logging frequency, in number of iterations (default:
            10)
        key_best (function or None): a key function for comparing states.
            Checkpointing the greatest.

    Returns:
        a configured Recipe
